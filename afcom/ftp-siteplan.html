        <p>I'm Joseph Margay a student of BYU Idaho studying Applied technology, i want to start an internet service
            company name Afcom that will solve the problem of slow connectivity of Internet in my country. The website
            is going to have all the details concerning everything relating to internet business. A landing page which
            have all the details about the business, a contact us page which show potential clients how to reach us for
            enquirers. For far too long in my country Sierra Leone access to high speed Internet have been a huge
            problem, now with the help of Afcom that gap will be filled by our incredible service which include VPN,
            Internet connections that will use either microwave and fiber connection.
