            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p><b>What is rafting?</b> </p>
            <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to
                navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough
                water. </p>
            <p><b>Dry Ora Rafting is in the forefron of raft safety</b></p>
            <p>Recognised as the world body which oversees the certification and training of professional river rafting
                guides, Dry ora works closely with national organisations and government bodies by offering the only
                rafting guide certification program accepted worldwide. Through our various courses and certifications,
                we can ensure a global standard of guides while continually evolving raft techniques to keep everyone
                safer on rafting excursions.
            </p>
            <p><b>Dry Ora is deeply committed to protecting the rivers of our planet</b></p>
            <p>We recognise that humans are not the owners of our planet, but instead are its caretakers and stewards.
                We believe free flowing rivers are necessary for a healthy world, and we strive to protect them from
                senseless destruction. Our intimate connection with rivers and the natural environment places us in a
                key role dedicated towards educating others to ensure that future generations enjoy sustainable access
                to clean water and free flowing rivers.</p>

            <p>This site will focus greatly on younger people as well as average and older people. </p>

            <p style="color:#a8337b">Dry ora train people to rift and also creat job. In a dissertation, thesis,
                academic journal article (or pretty much any formal piece of research), you’ll find a research
                methodology chapter (or section) which covers the aspects mentioned above. Importantly, a good
                methodology chapter in a dissertation or thesis explains not just what methodological choices were made,
                but also explains why they were made.<br>
                We also advertise rafting. In other words, the methodology chapter should
                justify the design choices, by showing that the chosen methods and techniques are the best fit for
                the research aims and objectives, and will provide valid and reliable results. A good research
                methodology provides scientifically sound findings, whereas a poor methodology doesn’t. We’ll look
                at the main design choices below.<br>
                tis will display white text. It’s quite common for a qualitative
                methodology to be used when the research aims and objectives are exploratory in nature. For
                example, a qualitative methodology might be used to understand peoples’ perceptions about an
                event that took place, or a candidate running for president. </p>
