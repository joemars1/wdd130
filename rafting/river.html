            <h2>What We DO</h2>
            <section class="section1">


                <img class="river1" src="images/river1.jpg" alt="Placeholder image for description">

                <p class="para">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given
                    the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number
                    of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never
                    left.

                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
                    commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
                    over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed
                    rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
                    early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                    summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower,
                    warmer water more.</p>

            <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
          
                <p class="para">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river
                    flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
                    scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to
                    Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
                    formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>
