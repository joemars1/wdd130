    <p>
        These questions typically tested single <strong>rules in isolation.</strong>  Furthermore, they were "tricky" in the
        sense that the SAT would use the same methods to obfuscate the grammar rule being tested. If you weren't
        familiar with these tricks, you would be likely to get the question wrong.

        For example, the rodeo question above tests <em>Number Agreement</em>. The error is B - "rodeo" is a singular noun, which
        means "they predate" should be replaced by "it predates." The SAT complicates this rule by inserting a
        complicated phrase in betweesn ("includes games...century"). On the current SAT, this is one of the most common
        skills tested, and it nearly always shows up in this way. If you don't know this trick the SAT plays, it's
        harder to answer the question.
